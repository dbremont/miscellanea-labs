# Introduction to Practice Problems in Natural Language Processing (NLP)  

> Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field at the intersection of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. From powering search engines and virtual assistants to enabling automatic translation and sentiment analysis, NLP is integral to many modern applications.  

This set of practice problems is designed to provide hands-on experience with the fundamental and advanced concepts in NLP. Through these exercises, youâ€™ll gain insights into how machines process text and speech and learn to build systems capable of solving real-world language-related challenges.

## Problems

Text Preprocessing:

- Tokenization: Splitting text into words, sentences, or subwords.  
- Stopword Removal: Filtering common but non-informative words (e.g., "and," "the").  
- Lemmatization and Stemming: Reducing words to their base or root form.  
- Regular Expressions: Finding and processing patterns in text.  

Text Representation:

- Bag of Words (BoW): Representing text using word frequencies.  
- TF-IDF: Highlighting important terms in a document relative to a corpus.  
- Word Embeddings: Working with representations like Word2Vec, GloVe, or fastText.  
- Sentence Embeddings: Exploring embeddings like BERT, GPT, and Sentence Transformers.  

Language Modeling and Generation:

- N-gram Models: Building simple statistical models to predict word sequences.  
- Modern Language Models: Working with transformer-based models like GPT, BERT, and T5.  
- Text Generation: Creating systems capable of generating coherent and meaningful text.  

Text Classification:

- Sentiment Analysis: Classifying text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.  
- Spam Detection: Identifying spam emails or messages.  
- Topic Modeling: Assigning categories to text documents based on their content.  

Named Entity Recognition (NER):

- Extracting entities like names, locations, dates, and organizations from text.  
- Building models for recognizing domain-specific entities (e.g., in legal or medical text).  

Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:

- Assigning grammatical categories (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) to words in a sentence.  

Syntactic and Semantic Parsing:

- Parsing sentences to understand grammatical structure (e.g., dependency and constituency parsing).  
- Understanding meaning and relationships within sentences.  

Sequence-to-Sequence Problems:

- Machine Translation: Translating text from one language to another.  
- Text Summarization: Creating concise summaries of long documents.  
- Question Answering: Building systems that can answer questions based on given context.  

Sentiment and Emotion Analysis:

- Detecting underlying sentiment or emotion in text (e.g., anger, joy, sadness).  

Speech and Multimodal Processing:

- Speech-to-Text: Converting spoken language into written text.  
- Text-to-Speech: Generating speech from written text.  
- Multimodal Systems: Combining text with images or audio for richer understanding.
